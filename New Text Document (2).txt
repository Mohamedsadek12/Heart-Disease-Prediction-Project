Heart Disease Prediction Using UCI Dataset 
This project focuses on developing a Artificial Intelligence model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic data.
The UCI Heart Disease Dataset includes 13 key features such as age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate achieved.
Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (ID3), and KNN, the goal is to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease or not.
This model can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making. 
Preprocessing: Before building your models, you need to make sure that the dataset is clean and ready-to-use.
Feature Selection and Extraction: Visualize correlation.
Modeling Step: 
•Choose the best technique to predict the potability of Heart Disease with a high accuracy. You must prove by the code that the chosen algorithm produces a higher accuracy than the other algorithms.
• Try to use Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree (ID3),and KNN. Model Evaluation: • Accuracy • Confusion matrix 
• Classification report UCI Heart Disease Dataset – Description The UCI Heart Disease Dataset is a well-known medical dataset collected from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, originally made available by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains 303 patient records, each with 13 clinical attributes used to predict the presence or absence of heart disease.
• Target Variable: o target (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease) 
• Key Features: o age: Age of the patient o sex: Gender (1 = male; 0 = female) o cp: Chest pain type (0–3) o trestbps: Resting blood pressure o chol: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) o fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) o restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results o thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved o exang: Exercise-induced angina o oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise o slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment o ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy o thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect) 
UCI Dataset Bonus Tasks: 
• Use any feature selection or feature extraction methods. 
• Implement one of the classification algorithms that you have learned from scratch. (You must understand the steps very well) 
• Make an application with a well-designed GUI that accepts the data of Heart Disease measurements from the user and the input classification method (SVM , ID3, …) then predict if the Heart Disease Prediction is potable or not. implement it as python code
